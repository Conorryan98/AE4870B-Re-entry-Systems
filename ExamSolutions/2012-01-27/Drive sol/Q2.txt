c)
no lift (L=0)

d)
start from q_c = c_1 * 1/R_N^n * rho^{1-n} * V^m and notice that q_c is dependent on: rho^{1-n} * {V/V_E}^3
substitute the expression for rho (given) and ignore all constant terms. take the derivative of q_c wrt. V/V_E=0 for max. heat flow (use chain rule for derivative), solve and re-substitute in the given expression for rho

m=3 is typical

n is 0.5 for laminar and 0.2 for turbulent boundary layer


e)
just remember that beta=1/H
substitute to find rho'', then use: rho=rho_0*exp(-beta*h) to find h
h= 51,385m
