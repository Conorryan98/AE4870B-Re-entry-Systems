a)
proportional: q_c = K_p * q_c,err

integral: q_c = K_i * int(q_c,err) dtau

derivative: q_c = K_d * dq_c,err/dt


For final q_c, add all three components

b)
See reader pp. 355ff. Start from equation of motion, solve for D, which requires you to find an expression for dV/dt. you get that expression by taking the time derivative of q_c. watch the chain rule (V and rho). Use the exponential atmosphere to find an expression for drho/dt=drho/dh*dh/dt

c)
D_cmd = D_0 + DELTA_D

d)
D_cmd = 0.5*rho*V^2*S*C_D

Solve for C_D as CD=f(alpha,M)

e)
ideas:
S: known
C_D: known
rho: use dynamic pressure and temperature measurements
beta: horizon sensor + IMU
m: known
g: known (approx g_0)
V: use dynamic pressure and temperature measurements + IMU
