a)
note that D>>W and L>>W, ignore the respective terms, divide equation parallel and normal to velocity by each other to get dV/dgamma, integrate with L/D=constant

for the second equation, start with

V*dgamma/dt=L/m
and transfer it to:
V*dgamma/dpressure *dpressure/dh * dh/dt

dh/dt=V sin(gamma)
dpressure/dh follows from p=-g*rho*h

use
L=0.5*V^2*C_L*rho*S

substitute, move terms to the respective sides and integrate from entry conditions _E to whatever

the entry conditions are somewhere high up (120km or so), so there's like literally zero air up there (almost). thus, make the bold move of stating that p_E=0 and you're almost done

Now reform with the help of p=R*T*rho and R*T=g/beta

qed

b)
apply the formula and notice that leaving: gamma_F=-gamma_E
at lowest point: gamma=0
at peak, gamma=0 and V=V_F*cos(gamma_E)
at second reentry: V_E2 = V_F

c)
use formula of part a, set gamma=0, notice that 1-cos(x)=2*sin^2(x/2) and be happy, 'cause you just found the density
now apply the density on the exponential atmosphere model, notice that beta=1/H and you're there
