Same as Question 3, Jan 2012

a)
limit the impact speed (mechanical load constraint)
control descent duration (communication constraint   - why the hell is this called 'communcation' constraint??)

b)
pilot: deploy a larger parachute
main: decelerate, duh
drogue: stabilise vehicle and/or provide initial deceleration

c)
restrict canopy at the skirt
reduces drag area
reduces opening loads
why? see above

d)
provide redundancy
increases total drag area
multiple smaller canopies easier to provide than one large one
shorter inflation time
increases stability

e)
Equilibrium: V_dot = 0

f)
8	11.29 m
10	9.032 m
12	7.526 m
